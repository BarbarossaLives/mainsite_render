      "content": "<h2> 3D with Python </h2>\r\n<p>Python is not know for its ability to make 3D games.  But as a Python developer I want to explore the options that are out there. Godot is probably the most used option,even though it is technically not Python. Gd Script is the scripting languse that was written specifically for Godot, however is follow all the basic rules of python for syntax, for and while loops, variable declaration(or not) and other systems that a python programmer would be intimately familiar with. These images were made in blender with some great sets of models from KayBits over on itch.io, The pack does have eveerything I needed but was able to make a table work as a door using boleans and it turned out great.  UPBGE rendered this just fine and after some searching I was able to get a simple capsule moving around.  The method of registering the scripts and using them has changes over the versions and the docs for the script has not.)  </p>\r\n\t\r\n<img scr=\"Tavern_2_Blender.png\">\r\n\t\r\n<p> In UPBGE the collision's just worked because the physics engine is already to go.  Just had to make sure the player capsule had a character body physic's type on it.  Godot imported the .GLB files without issue, however you need to go through each item to make sure the collision body is being generated. While this is a pain in the ass when first bringing in the models, the fact that you can set the mesh type would probably create great advantages in the speed the program can handle later on.  Ursina was a bit more difficult but also a bit more specific.  Ursina can simple create its best guess at a mesh by adding the collider syntax to the instance of the model, but the result can we a bit unreliable during game play and it is essentially duplicationing the entire mush to act as the collision item. This quickly gets your game to do a lot of calculations it just doesn't need to be doing.  The best oprioon is you the artist to create a very simplified version of the meshes and import it and make that the collision mesh.  If i threw around to  many term or didn't technically use them in the right way I apologize, but I think most people interrested in my work will be able to follow along. </p>\r\n\r\n<img scr=\"Tavern_3_Blender.png>\r\n\r\n<p>I will be posting more of these tests from the differnt engines and share my experiances as I work through my projects.  Support me over at Ko-Fi or where ever you are seeing the onformation simply by sharing</p>\r\n\r\n<Next Up:  some in engine renders and the code it took, if any!!</p>?",

      "content": "<p>\r\nTo deepen my understanding of <strong>FastAPI</strong> and the full development process, I\u2019ve started building a custom <strong>Business Suite</strong>. This includes a <strong>Project and Event Tracker</strong>, along with a <strong>Posting Tool</strong> that lets you share a link, write a simple post, and attach an image \u2014 all while publishing to multiple social media platforms at once.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInstead of rushing, I\u2019ve taken a step-by-step approach: first outlining the basic GUI structure and layout, then gradually adding functionality piece by piece. This method has led to a smoother, faster, and more maintainable development experience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\u2019m building this suite for myself \u2014 both as a tool I\u2019ll actually use and as a demonstration of the kinds of solutions I can create for <strong>small business owners, freelancers, and artists</strong>. Personally, project management has always been a challenge. It\u2019s easy to get distracted by the latest idea instead of staying focused on what needs to get done.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe posting tool is especially important to me right now. I\u2019m ready to start taking on clients and growing my business, but the consistency required to stay visible and advertise myself has been a real struggle. I often overthink my value, what I should be doing, and how to do it \u201cright.\u201d My hope is that by speeding up the content creation and publishing process, I can overcome some of that hesitation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI built this website myself, and I\u2019m actively expanding my Business Suite. These tools are <strong>real examples</strong> of the kind of work I can do for you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBeyond that, I\u2019m also in the early stages of developing <strong>Rule Beyton</strong> \u2014 a top-down 3D game about a young rogue rising through the ranks of the local thieves\u2019 guild \u2014 as well as a suite of <strong>TTRPG tools</strong> for solo players and game masters. These tools will eventually form the foundation for another game project.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please follow my journey and share my work if you can. There\u2019s a lot more to come \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be exciting.</strong></p>\r\n",
